# Heya! ðŸ‘‹

## Hi! I'm Sophia, and I'm a junior at Cal Poly SLO. Here on this profile are different personal projects I've worked on in the last few years.

<!--#### ðŸ¤© Currently learning and developing an app...-->
## The most recent personal project I've worked on is my Spotify Ad Skipper on March 20, 2025: https://github.com/soramicha/spotify-ad-skipper

## Future Personal Project Ideas:
#### Spotify Ad Skipper for iPhone?? - because my sister doesn't use the Spotify app on her computer :(
